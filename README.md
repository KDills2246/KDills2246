### Hi I'm Katie ðŸ‘‹ 
**About Me**

I graduated from Florida Polytehcnic University with my undergrad in Science and Technology Management with a concentration in Supply Chain Management. I'm currently pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science. My hobbys include hanging out on the lake :ocean: and wood working projects around the house :hammer:. I spend any free time hanging out with my husband and dogs.
